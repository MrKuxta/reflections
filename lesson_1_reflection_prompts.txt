How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    A diff or FC helps identifying bugs as one can compare a file that works and a file that doesn't.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can actually see at any time what the progress of your code is and understand what the keys decision point back in time to evolve your code

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The automatic solutions are saving the files automatically in defined intervals without any logical reasoning. Manual commits are better because it
	helps you keep it short and based on logical checkpoints

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Saving multiple files (of repository) in one commit is very efficient, especially for interlinked files like htl and css

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log gives you all the history of the repository and it diff compares two commit ids

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can restore older commits at any time

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For a project
